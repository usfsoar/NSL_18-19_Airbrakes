# 2018-2019 NASA Student Launch Airbrakes Code for SOAR's Apis III Rocket [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/usfsoar/NSL_18-19_Airbrakes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/usfsoar/NSL_18-19_Airbrakes)
Code for the Society of Aeronautics and Rocketry's airbrakes system, designed for
the NASA Student Launch 2019. The system codename is DAAS, or Dynamic Apogee
Adjustment Subsystem.

At the moment the code is just boilerplate. Check back after April for the final
competition code!

More info about the competition can be found at

_Note_: Build status (above) confirms that the latest code compiles on Arduino,
not that it necessarily behaves as expected.
